# LINVIEW OSS for LINSTOR (Beta)

## Version: 0.8-beta (released 08/01/20)

## This project is being heavily developed and there may be breaking changes.

**LINVIEW OSS** is the open-source version of LINVIEW storage dashboard to visualize LINSTOR (https://www.linbit.com/linstor/) storage cluster.

**LINSTOR** is Block Storage Management For Containers.

With native integration to Kubernetes, LINSTOR makes building, running, and controlling block storage simple. LINSTOR is open-source software designed to manage block storage devices for large Linux server clusters. Itâ€™s used to provide persistent Linux block storage for Kubernetes, OpenStack, OpenNebula, and OpenShift environments. 

## What is LINVIEW OSS?
Linview OSS combines custom code with containerized Elastic, Kibana and Metricbeat to query the LINSTOR API and provide insight into your LINSTOR cluster. You do not need to provide Elastic or Kibana servers, it is all included in this deployment.

## Components
* Docker
* Elasticsearch
* Metricbeat
* Kibana

Elastic, Metricbeat and Kibana are often referred to as EMK, so when you see references to EMK, that is what it is referring to.

## Requirements
* Machine or VM with 4 CPU/ 8GB of RAM / 100GB Disk
* Linux (Tested on Ubuntu and CentOS)
* Docker CE Engine
* Docker Compose
* Target LINSTOR cluster
* OpenSSL
* EPEL Repo (CentOS Only)

## LINSTOR Cluster Setup
You will need an existing LINSTOR cluster to use this tool. 

If you need to configure a basic LINSTOR cluster on Ubuntu, you can follow instructions below:

* *Official LINSTOR documentation:* https://www.linbit.com/drbd-user-guide/linstor-guide-1_0-en/#s-installation
* *Basic 3 Node Setup Script for Ubuntu:* https://github.com/AlphaBravoCompany/linstor-ubuntu-demo 
* *Vito Botta blog:* https://vitobotta.com/2019/08/07/linstor-storage-with-kubernetes/

We are actively developing installation scripts to streamline controller and satellite setup, storage pool creation and resource creation. We will update this README once this is complete.

## Docker and Docker-Compose Install
You will need Docker and Docker Compose installed on the host where LINVIEW OSS will be deployed. You can use one of the following links to guide you through the install.

* Official Docker Install: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/
* Office Docker-Compose Install: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/
* Custom Docker and Docker-Compose Install Scripts: https://github.com/linviewio/docker-and-compose-install

## Setting up LINVIEW OSS
1. On the machine where LINVIEW OSS will be hosted, clone this repo.
2. Change int the LINSTOR OSS directory `cd linview-oss`
3. Add execute to the setup script `chmod +x ./setup.sh`
4. Run `./setup.sh` and enter the details for the Docker/Kibana host and the LINSTOR Controller host. The install automatically creates a local cert based on the information provided to configure HTTPS access to the system.
5. Login to the interface at `https://KIBANAFQDNORIP` (the FQDN you provided) with username `elastic` and password that you provided during install.

## Updating and Import Dashboards
1. In the `/linview-oss/import` directory on the Docker host, copy `LINSTORHOST-linview-kibana.ndjson` file to your local machine. This file was automatically modified during install and should contain proper values based on the questions you answered during the install.
2. In Kibana, navigate to `Management`, `Kibana`, `Saved Objects` and the choose `Import` and select the modified import file from step 1.
3. Now you can navigate to [LINVIEW] saved objects in Kibana under "Dashboards".

## Roadmap
* Interface "Quick Start Guide"
* Add support to use Open Distro for Elastic
* Updated dashboard elements for a more concise and informative layout
* Instructions for alerting using Elastic xPack alerting (paid Elastic feature)
* Other Improvements
